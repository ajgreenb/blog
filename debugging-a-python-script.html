<h1>
Debugging a Python script
</h1>

<span class="date">
March 3, 2018
</span>

<p>
The other night I wrote a Python script to group my
<a href="https://scripted.org">ScriptEd</a> students into 5 tables. I wanted the
groupings to be random, but I wanted both males and females to be equally
distributed at each table&mdash;or at least, as close as possible, since we have
a few more males than females.
</p>

<p>
My first iteration of the script looked like this:
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
from random import shuffle

NUM_GROUPS = 5

MALES = [
  'M1',
  'M2',
  'M3',
  'M4',
  'M5',
  'M6',
  'M7',
  'M8',
  'M9',
]

FEMALES = [
  'F1',
  'F2',
  'F3',
  'F4',
  'F5',
  'F6',
  'F7',
]

shuffle(MALES)
shuffle(FEMALES)

groups = [ [] ] * NUM_GROUPS

for i in range(len(MALES) + len(FEMALES)):
  if i % 2 == 0 and FEMALES:
    groups[i % NUM_GROUPS].append(FEMALES.pop())
  else:
    groups[i % NUM_GROUPS].append(MALES.pop())

print(groups)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Nothing <em>too</em> complicated&mdash;loop through the total number of
students, and if the current index is even and there are unplaced females, place
one of them in the current group. Otherwise, place a male in the current group.
</p>

<p>
This script breaks when the number of groups to assign is even, since the
assignment logic uses modular arithmetic that will always assign the males and
females to separate groups. But, since I was using an odd number of groups, I
didn&apos;t have to worry about that problem.
</p>

<p>
Aside from that, though, I had introduced a separate bug. The output from
running that script looks something like this (newlines and indentation added
for clarity):
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
[
  [ 'F7', 'M4', 'F3', 'M7', 'F4', 'M6', 'F5', 'M3', 'F1', 'M2', 'F2', 'M5', 'F6', 'M8', 'M1', 'M9' ],
  [ 'F7', 'M4', 'F3', 'M7', 'F4', 'M6', 'F5', 'M3', 'F1', 'M2', 'F2', 'M5', 'F6', 'M8', 'M1', 'M9' ],
  [ 'F7', 'M4', 'F3', 'M7', 'F4', 'M6', 'F5', 'M3', 'F1', 'M2', 'F2', 'M5', 'F6', 'M8', 'M1', 'M9' ],
  [ 'F7', 'M4', 'F3', 'M7', 'F4', 'M6', 'F5', 'M3', 'F1', 'M2', 'F2', 'M5', 'F6', 'M8', 'M1', 'M9' ],
  [ 'F7', 'M4', 'F3', 'M7', 'F4', 'M6', 'F5', 'M3', 'F1', 'M2', 'F2', 'M5', 'F6', 'M8', 'M1', 'M9' ]
]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Each group had <em>all</em> the students in it! I combed through each line of
code several times, unable to figure out how this was happening. Because the
code is simple&mdash;the main looping and assignment logic is only 5 lines
&mdash;I started thinking truly farfetched thoughts: had I somehow corrupted my
Python build?
</p>

<p>
Stumped, I set the script aside and left to cycle my laundry. As it often
happens, while walking to the laundromat, an idea popped into my head. As soon
as I got back, I tested my idea and it worked. Here&apos;s the problematic line:
</p>


<div class="code">
<pre>
groups = [ [] ] * NUM_GROUPS
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I expected <code>[ [] ] * NUM_GROUPS</code> to create a list containing 5
different empty lists. Instead, that line of code creates a list containing 5
<em>references</em> to a <em>single</em> list. When adding a member to the first
list, <em>all</em> lists received the member, because there was only a single
underlying Python object for that list.
</p>

<p>
Curious to understand the underlying implementation responsible for this
behavior, I dug into the source code for the Python interpreter. Since the
problematic line of code involves multiplying a list by a number, here&apos;s
the routine Python uses for multiplying two things (excerpted from
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/f320be77ffb73e3b9e7fc98c37b8df3975d84b40/Objects/abstract.c#L982-L999">
abstract.c</a>):
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
PyObject *
PyNumber_Multiply(PyObject *v, PyObject *w)
{
    PyObject *result = binary_op1(v, w, NB_SLOT(nb_multiply));
    if (result == Py_NotImplemented) {
        PySequenceMethods *mv = v->ob_type->tp_as_sequence;
        PySequenceMethods *mw = w->ob_type->tp_as_sequence;
        Py_DECREF(result);
        if  (mv && mv->sq_repeat) {
            return sequence_repeat(mv->sq_repeat, v, w);
        }
        else if (mw && mw->sq_repeat) {
            return sequence_repeat(mw->sq_repeat, w, v);
        }
        result = binop_type_error(v, w, "*");
    }
    return result;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
It attempts to multiply the two objects using <code>binary_op1</code>. If that
returns <code>Py_NotImplemented</code> (and it will for a Python list object),
it tries using <code>sequence_repeat</code>. For a list object,
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/13cfd57dcf58485d6242fd8118c6ea4b10e29aab/Objects/listobject.c#L2700">
<code>sequence_repeat</code> maps to <code>list_repeat</code>.</a> Here&apos;s
the relevant part of the implementation for <code>list_repeat</code> (excerpted
from
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/13cfd57dcf58485d6242fd8118c6ea4b10e29aab/Objects/listobject.c#L523-L531">
listobject.c</a>):
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
items = np-&gt;ob_item;
if (Py_SIZE(a) == 1) {
    elem = a-&gt;ob_item[0];
    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        items[i] = elem;
        Py_INCREF(elem);
    }
    return (PyObject *) np;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
A couple quick definitions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>a</code> is the list that will be repeated.
</li>
<li>
<code>np</code> is the new, repeated version of <code>a</code>.
</li>
<li>
<code>items</code> is a reference to the objects contained by <code>np</code>.
</li>
<li>
<code>elem</code> is a reference to the first (and only) object in
<code>a</code>.
</li>
<li>
<code>n</code> is the number of times to repeat the list.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can see in the line <code>items[i] = elem;</code> that each slot in the new,
repeated list points to the same singular <code>elem</code>. The
<code>Py_INCREF</code> line says it all: each time the repeated element is added
to the new list, Python increments the reference count for that object.
</p>

<p>
Fixing the behavior required ensuring that <code>groups</code> contained a list
of separate lists, rather than a list of references to the same list.
